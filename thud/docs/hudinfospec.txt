a.  The HUDINFO Protocol
------------------------

 The HUDINFO protocol is designed to allow easy communication between the
MUX server and any automated or semi-automated Battletech client. It
provides all info players can get through the conventional commands, but
drops issues such as readability and hysterical raisins in favour of
flexible and efficient communication.


b.  About this document
-----------------------

 This document describes version 0.6 of the HUDINFO specification. It is not
finished, should be considered a work in progress and should only be used as
a rough guideline in the development of a HUD client. Discussion about this
document, the standard described herein or other aspects of HUD clients can
be held at the mailinglist btech-discussions@lists.sourceforge.net, or the
HUD channel on 3030MUX. There is currently no known implementation of this
specification, neither client-side nor server-side.

c.  The HUDINFO command
-----------------------

 The crux of the HUDINFO protcol is the 'hudinfo' command. Almost all of the
data is retrieved using the hudinfo command. All hudinfo responses meant to
be parsed by the software at the client-side are prefixed by (at least)
"#HUD". For everything but the argument-less 'hudinfo' command, the complete
prefix is built up as follows:

   #HUD:<key>:<class>:<type># 

where '<key>' is a session key, '<class>' is the identifier for the
subcommand the response comes from, and '<type>' is one of 'R' (single-line
response), 'L' (multi-line response list), 'S' (start of response list), 'D'
(end of response list) or 'E' (error response). Each 'class' of message has
a distinct response format for each 'type' of response, and all responses
come in that format. For future compatibility, extra fields at the end of
the format should be accepted but ignored.

 The session key is included for spoof protection. It has to be set before
issueing any hudinfo command that returns data (any hudinfo command except
the argument-less form or the 'hudinfo key' command), and for simplicity
must consist of alphanumerical characters alone, of no more than 20
characters. A simple 3-character key is deemed sufficient for common use.


d.  HUDINFO response format
---------------------------

 The actual message that follows the HUDINFO prefix in each message, is
presented as comma-seperated values, where the values can be of various
types. Values will never contain a comma, but extra trailing fields are
possible and should be ignored; they are a result of a new minor version or
experimental features.

 The actual values can be of different types types, where the type is
defined in this specification (and not, like XML, given in the response.)
The values are all the ASCII representations of the values, not their actual
byte value; so, the value 0 is represented as the string '0', not as the NUL
character, and the value 65 is '65', not 'A'. The complete list of types as
well as their definition and meaning can be found in section V, Data Type
Definitions.


e.  HUDINFO Errors
------------------

 When the 'hudinfo' command needs to report an error, be it because an
operation cannot be performed, an unknown or illegal subcommand is issued or
because of internal problems, a response is generated of type 'E'. In the
case of an unknown or illegal subcommand, the 'class' of such a response is
set to '???'.

 Some error messages are common to all or almost all hudinfo commands; these
are listed here. Some error messages apply only to specific commands, and
are listed in those commands.

   "<subcommand>: subcommand not found":
	The subcommand given does not exist.

   "Not in a BattleTech unit":
	The command was issued outside of a BattleTech unit.

   "You are destroyed!":
	The command was issued in a destroyed BattleTech unit.

   "Reactor not online":
	The command was issued from a shutdown BattleTech unit, but
	requirs an operating one.

   "Unexpected internal error!":
	An internal error occured, report +bug.

   "No such target":
	When referencing a (currently) unknown mechid.

   "Out of range":
	The target or location is out of range.


                 II.  The special-case HUDINFO commands
                 ======================================

 The following special-cased hudinfo commands are special for two reasons:
they can (and should) be issued before a session key is set, and they can be
issued outside of a BattleTech unit. In addition, the response generated by
'hudinfo' is of a different format.

a. The argument-less 'hudinfo' command

   command:
	hudinfo
   response:
   Exactly one:
	#HUD hudinfo version 1.0 [options: <option flags>]
   Or exactly one:
        Huh?  (Type "help" for help.)

   Purpose: Identification

 The argument-less 'hudinfo' command is a special case of the 'hudinfo'
command, the only form that does not returns a response with a session key.
Instead, it returns a version identifier and a list of supported uptions, so
clients can autodetect whether a MUX supports hudinfo and if so, which
version.

 The version number is built up from 'major' and 'minor' version, both
integers, separated by a dot. The version number is not a floating point
number; 1.9 is smaller than 1.10, and not the same as 1.90. The major
version differs only between versions of the protocol that are wholly
incompatible; a HUD client that discovers a major mode it does not know
should not try to use hudinfo. The minor version is increased when new
standard features are added in a backwards-compatible manner; clients should
not break or refuse to work if the minor version is higher than expected,
though they may do so if the minor version is lower than required.

 The optional 'options' section, if present, should contain a list of option
flags for non-standard new features, which are used to add non-standard or
experimental features without creating conflicts on the version number. Such
options and their option flags should preferably be registered by mailing to
the contacts in section Ib, "About this Document", both for inclusion in the
next version of the protocol, and to avoid collisions with other options.

   Example:
    > hudinfo
    < #HUD hudinfo version 1.0


b. The session-key setting 'hudinfo key' command.

   command:
	hudinfo key=<key>
   response:
	#HUD:<key>:KEY:R# Key set

  This command is used to set the sesion key. It should be issued before any
hudinfo command other than the argument-less hudinfo, in order to set the
session key. The session key is a short (1-20 character) preferably
non-deterministic string of alphanumeric characters that serves as spoof
protection. The string is case-sensitive.

   Example:
    > hudinfo key=C58x2
    < #HUD:C58x2:KEY:R# Key set

   Error messages:

    "Invalid key":
	Invalid characters used in key, or key too long.

   pairs of characters for terrain elevation and terrain type. One pair (two
   characters) per X-coordinate of the tactical string. Water hexes have
   depth instead of height (their top level is always 0).
